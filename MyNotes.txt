Power BI project: CREDIT CARD CUSTOMER REPORT AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION REPORT (Credit Card Financial Dashboard)
1.Project Overview
Project Objective: To develop a comprehensive credit card dashboard that provides real time insights into key performance metrices and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyse credit card operations effectively.

2.Data Extraction
Import data into SQL Database
1.Prepare CSV files
Credit Card.csv =18 columns
Average utilization ratio =  revolving Balance / credit limit .Lesser Average utilization ratio  means good customer
use chip = how you used card for making  transaction (swipe, online , chip)
Expenditure type = Where did you spend.(Bills, food, entertainment..)
Interest = How much did it go to the bank
Delinquest account = Default account ( users unable to pay back credit)

Customer.csv = columns

2.Create tables in SQL
3.Import CSV file to SQL
       


3.Data Processing and DAX Query
In cust_details table create new column:
AgeGroyp = SWITCH( 
    TRUE(),
    cust_detail[Customer_Age]<30,"less than 30",
    cust_detail[Customer_Age]>=30 && cust_detail[Customer_Age] <40, "30-40",
    cust_detail[Customer_Age]>=40 && cust_detail[Customer_Age] <50, "40-50",
    cust_detail[Customer_Age]>=50 && cust_detail[Customer_Age] <60, "50-60",
    cust_detail[Customer_Age]>=60,"60+",
    "unknown"
    ) 
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(TRUE(),
 cust_detail[Income]<35000,"Low",
 cust_detail[Income]>=35000 && cust_detail[Income]<70000,"Medium",
 cust_detail[Income]>=70000,"High",
 "Unknown"

 )


In cc_details create new columns:
Revenue = cc_detail[Annual_Fees]+ cc_detail[Total_Trans_Amt]+cc_detail[Interest_Earned] 

week_num2 = WEEKNUM(cc_detail[Week_Start_Date])

To calculate week on week revencue, (to get revenue of the current week)...i.e create 2 measures of current week and previous week

Current_week_revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM(cc_detail[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(cc_detail),
        cc_detail[week_num2]=MAX(cc_detail[week_num2])))

Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM(cc_detail[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(cc_detail),
        cc_detail[week_num2]=MAX(cc_detail[week_num2])-1)) 

To calculate week over week revenue,
wow_revenue = DIVIDE(([Current_week_revenue]-[Previous_week_Revenue]),[Previous_week_Revenue])
